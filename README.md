# Linear-Control-Systems
This project focuses on modeling and controlling blood glucose levels in diabetic patients using the Bergman minimal model. Students analyze the dynamics between insulin and glucose through state-space equations, and design controllers in both time and frequency domains. MATLAB is used for simulation, with an emphasis on system stability, disturbance rejection, and physiological relevance."
